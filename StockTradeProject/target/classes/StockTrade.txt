Java Practice Programming

1.) Read StockTrade from a CSV FILE
    We will write a small java program that will read a StockTrade CSV(comma seperated file) and convert it into the StockTrade object and does some     analysis on it

   -CSV File will have following fields(Security:String,Date:util.Date,Open:Double,High:Double,Low:Double,Close:Double,Volume:Double,Adj Close:Double)
   -create a Java class StockTrade(Domain Object) that will hold the value of one Stock Trade
   
   
   IStockTradeReader
    //reads the trade from CSV file convert it into StockTrade Object and return it as List
	public List<StockTrade> readStockTrades() throws StockTradeInValidFormatException
	//Find the Stock trade out of the List that has max vvolume
	public StockTrade getMaxVolumeTrade(List<StockTrade>)
	//Find the Stock trade out of the List that has min vvolume
	public StockTrade getMinVolumeTrade(List<StockTrade>)
	//Return the difference of open vs High that is high-open with Date being the Key and value being the difference
	public Map<Date,Double> getDailyTradingDifferential(List<StockTrade>)

   
  CSVStockTradeReader implements IStockTradeReader {
   //The following private methods are advised to read and transform the Line in CSV
   private StockTrade parseStockCSVLine(String csLine)
   //you are open to add other private methods
   }
